The problem we are addressing is the growing burden of mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and phobias, in India and around the world. The lack of access to mental health professionals and the economic burden on individuals and society further exacerbate the problem.

To address this, we propose two solutions.

First, We provide the use of audio rooms, where users can join in a talk their heart out to other participants, while we analyze their speech pattern and produce a sentiments analysis which can be used to help identify individuals who may be suffering from depression or phobias. We are also leveraging machine learning to detect posture inaccuracies and correct them, as poor posture has been linked to anxiety and depression.

Second, we are proposing a virtual reality solution that includes exposure therapy, guided meditation, and posture correction. The controlled environment virtual solutions are designed to help individuals overcome their fears and phobias by gradually exposing them to different levels of difficulty in a safe and controlled virtual environment. The virtual reality experience also provides a unique and immersive way to practice meditation, which can help alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Overall, our solution offers a novel approach to addressing mental health conditions by providing a safe and immersive environment for exposure therapy, meditation, and posture correction, ultimately helping individuals overcome their fears and improve their mental health.
